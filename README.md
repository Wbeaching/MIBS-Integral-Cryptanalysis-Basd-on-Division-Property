# MIBS_Integral_Cryptanalysis_Basd_on_Division_Property
Applying the MILP method to search bit-based integral distinguishers and degree estimation of the round function of MIBS block cipher, using division property.

Two Python classes are given here for the MILP-based integral cryptanalysis of MIBS block cipher. One class is used to search
integral distinguisher based on division property, and the other is used for getting an upper bound for the algebraic degree 
of the round funciton. There is a python script for each classes, which shows how to use these classes.
